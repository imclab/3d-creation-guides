# Tinkercad

I love Tinkercad. It's a simple tool that's pretty powerful. I still use it
pretty consistently for most of my 3d printing needs.

You'll need an account (free!) and then hit this lovely button to start a new
project.

From there you'll be tossed into a screen where you can just click & drag any of
the objects on the right into the main scene. You can also click the object then
click the scene to place it. Once you've placed an object in the scene, you can
change it's dimensions by using the black or white square draggers that show up
around it:

You can rotate the object with the curved arrows that surround it:

Or move the whole thing by either click & drag, or using the straight arrows
surrounding it:

Any clicking on the scene is for selection or movement of the existing objects.

Tinkercad also has many "holes" or shapes that you can subtract from others.
This lets you do things like add a small hole for a bolt or magnet.

This hole becomes more visible if you select both it and the object and group
them:

To actually change how you're viewing it, you'll need the controls in the top
left:

The Tinkercad camera is a bit limited, it doesn't let you translate (move
around), only rotate while staring at the center of the model. The circle pad
rotates you around, while the + and - zoom in and out. The home button puts you
back where you started, and the cube zooms in on the object you have selected

Once you've created something you want to print, you'll want to save an STL. To do so, select "Download for 3D Printing" from the "Design" menu:

And then select STL
